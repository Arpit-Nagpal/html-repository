<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a recent graduate from Seneca College, specializing in Computer Programming. With a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking, I have developed skills in web development and program development using languages such as C, C++, and Python.
  <p>Currently, I am working as a technical advisor at Concentrix where I am providing the users of client's technical products with identifying, investigating, researching and providing resolution to their questions and problems. The problems are generally unstructured and require extensive use of conceptual thinking skills. Additionally, I am a part of engagement committee of local branch in which we organize different fun activities for the employees each month. 
    My experience as a customer service representative at Precise Parklink, a sales associate at High-End Gadgets and Lowe's Canada has honed my interpersonal and communication skills.</p>
  <p>As I continue to pursue a career in the tech field, I am actively seeking opportunities in web development and program development using C, C++, and Python. I am enthusiastic about learning new skills that may be required for any job profile in the industry.</p>
